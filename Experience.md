### 🎯 Research Projects & Workshop/Training
#### *Data Scientist Research Participant* -  pyRATES: Python and R Analysis of Time SerieS - LinkedEarth (*Jun 2024 - Oct 2024*)
- Developed a hybrid multivariate time series forecasting model integrating ARIMA, LSTM, and Transformer architectures using Python (TensorFlow,Statsmodels) to predict tidal dynamics across four Hawaiian stations, achieving RMSE < 0.4 ft and MAE < 0.32 ft.
- Optimized data preprocessing pipeline using Pandas and SciPy to handle missing values, scale attributes with MinMaxScaler, and extract seasonal trends through Fourier decomposition, improving model training efficiency by 30%.
- Applied advanced modeling techniques, including ARIMA for linear trend and seasonality, LSTM for capturing complex non-linear patterns, and Fourier + SARIMA for cyclical and short-term fluctuations, enhancing forecasting accuracy by 25%.
- Increased resource allocation efficiency by 40%, leveraging predictive insights to optimize coastal infrastructure investments and reduce disaster recovery costs.
- Generated 10-year tidal forecasts identifying peak tide periods and levels (e.g., Honolulu: 3.06 ft in Dec 2029), supporting strategic decision-making for flood risk management and infrastructure resilience planning.
- Visualized tidal patterns and model results using Python (Matplotlib,Seaborn) to identify key trends, correlations, and seasonal fluctuations, enabling actionable insights for coastal management and environmental risk reduction.
- Implemented model evaluation metrics, including RMSE and MAE, to benchmark performance across stations (Hilo: RMSE 0.33 ft, Honolulu: RMSE 0.31 ft), driving precision in long-term tidal predictions for disaster mitigation.
- Implemented scalable and reusable modeling pipelines, enabling efficient adaptation for other coastal regions, enhancing the project’s applicability for large-scale disaster risk assessments and climate impact studies.
  
#### *Data Analyst Research Participant* GO-BGC/BGC Argo Float Data Workshop - MBARI WHOI, UWash (*Aug 2023*) 
- Extracted float data using Python to map Hurricane Sam's float trajectory alongside hurricane tracks. 
- Created time series of temperature, chlorophyll-a (Chla), and particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp).
- Developed time series of sea surface temperature (SST), mixed layer depth (MLD), surface Chla and bbp, and depth-integrated Chla and bbp and applied despiking techniques to Chla and bbp data and subsetted the time series.
